# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Elkanah

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Computer Science student at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology  
ðŸ’» I'm passionate about AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science  
ðŸŒ± Currently learning **Python** and exploring **Machine Learning**  
ðŸ“Š Also tinkering with **R**, especially for data analysis and web scraping  
ðŸ“š Always curious about tech, critical thinking, and philosophy  
ðŸš€ Fun Fact: I love cat memes and debugging at 2 AM 

## Learning Journey

I'm building my machine learning skills through hands-on projects and self-directed study. My learning approach includes:

- **Independent project work** - All code written and executed by me
- **AI-assisted learning** - Using tools like Claude AI for concept explanations, debugging guidance, and best practice recommendations
- **Real-world datasets** - Working with Kaggle competitions and industry-standard problems
- **Iterative improvement** - Building portfolio through consistent daily practice

I believe in transparent learning. These projects represent my journey from data analysis basics to building predictive models, with guidance from AI tools that help me understand concepts deeply rather than just copying solutions.

##  Technologies & Tools
- Languages: Python, R
- Tools: Git & GitHub, RStudio, VS Code, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- Currently learning: Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Tensorflow
## SKills
**Data Science & ML:**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Data cleaning, EDA, visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Classification, Regression, Ensemble Methods)
- Model evaluation (Cross-validation, metrics analysis)
